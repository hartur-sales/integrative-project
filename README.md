Theater ABC Ticket Sales System

The Theater ABC is hiring a team to develop a ticket sales control system.

The requested software should include at least the following functionalities and must be developed as a Java Desktop application:

Functionalities:

Purchase Ticket: This feature should allow customers to enter their CPF and purchase a ticket for a specific play (three different plays) in a particular session (morning, afternoon, and evening). Additionally, customers need to specify the area they desire, as the ticket price depends on the chosen area, and select the seat they will occupy.

Print Ticket: This feature should enable customers to enter their CPF and print the purchased ticket receipt on the screen.

Sales Statistics: This feature allows users to view:

Which play sold the most and the least tickets;
Which session had the highest and lowest seat occupancy;
Which play/session was the most and least profitable;
The average profit of the theater for all areas by play.
Project Overview

During this project, we handled documentation, created spreadsheets, technical reports, and other elements that are part of the processes performed by a software engineer. Our objective was to simulate a real-world software development environment, ensuring that every step, from planning to execution, was meticulously documented and implemented.

Team Members:

Hartur Sales
Daniel Barbacena
Murilo Nunes

Conclusion:

This integrative project allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context, developing a functional software solution while adhering to industry standards and best practices. The experience gained from this project is invaluable and has prepared us for future challenges in the software engineering field.

ItÂ´s not perfect, but we learned a lot.
